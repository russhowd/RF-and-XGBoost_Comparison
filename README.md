# RF-and-XGBoost_Comparison
Jupyter Notebook exploring the Random Forest and XGBoost regression algorithms. Includes data import, cleaning, transformation, and basic exploration prior to training/test splits and grid searches for hyperparameters of models. 

Still a work in a progress, the notebook builds two regression models (RF and XGBoost) attempting to predict the change per hour of San Francisco bikeshare stations. The idea is that the bikeshare company could use such a model to anticipate under/over supply of bikes at all their stations given the time of day and weather that day. 

Will be updated as the models are basic and additional refinement and/or data engineering possible.
